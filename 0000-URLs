the livestreams are available under a plethora of different URLs; this shall serve as a collection of all known URLs/domains and other API endpoints.

The modern live stream URLs used by the Radiothek are <{shoutcast_slug}shoutcast.sf.apa.at/;>. (yes, with semicolon). This same slug is also used for loopstreams (stream recordings) that are available at <http://loopstream01.apa.at/?channel={shoutcast_slug}&id={program_file_name}>. NOTE: loopstream01 is probably meant for Ö1, loopstream{fm4,oe3,oe2[bknostvw],oe2st} exist for the others. But they resolve to the same IP address and the hostname is not checked, so all of them can be used interchangibly.


the old http://mp3stream{N}.apasf.apa.at:8000/ URLs are only available for the following channels:
name		N
------------------
Ö1		3
Ö3		7
FM4		1
Ö1 Campus	4
Radio NÖ	8
Radio OÖ	12
Radio St	9
Radio T		10
Radio V		11
Radio W		2

These are CNAMEs to fm4shoutcast.sf.apa.at., oe2tshoutcast.sf.apa.at., etc.

the other 3 stations don't seem to have mp3stream{N} subdomains. they do serve an ancient shoutcast stream on these URLs:

Radio B: http://194.232.200.146:8000
Radio K: http://194.232.200.145:8000
Radio S: http://194.232.200.147:8000
